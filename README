BrickCommand is a library for sending and receiving messages between a Java program
and the Lego Mindstorms EV3 with the standard 1.03H firmware.

The initial commit:
 - can send only in-programs (mailbox) system messages
 - uses a joystick as an input device (other may be developed if needed)
 - uses ONLY Bluetooth messaging (USB and WiFi are planned)
 - works ONLY under Windows (well, at least I haven't tested it in other environment)

The library is modular, but it is still a draft and the API is not set in stone.

As per licence, I will work on it later if I'll keep working on this project,
but for sure it will be some free/open software licence, so feel free to use this code as you please,
as long as you do not keep me accountable for any damage done by this libraries.

The code uses Java 1.8 but not as much as I'd like (source and target version is 1.7, used java API is 1.8).
